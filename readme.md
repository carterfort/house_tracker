##The Lists

We need to be able to share shopping lists. The simplest thing is to have  "listable" object, which can use a category (tag?) to identify where it shows up.

Grocery, Cleaning, Housework, Lumber, etc.

##Projects

Things that we're working on, whether it's solo or not, and what house resources will be consumed... expected completion? Duration? Best times of day?

##Schedule

Posts with types... vacation, work, social

##Chores Scores

A Chore model with a many-to-many relationship with the User model. How often must they be done? Are they inside/outside? What time of day can they be done?

##Bills

Help keep track of money going in/out
